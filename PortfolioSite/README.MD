For my midterm & final project I want to make a portfolio website that builds off of my current <a href="https://tinylionroars.tumblr.com/art">portfolio</a> & <a href="https://tinylionprototypes.tumblr.com">process</a> blogs aesthetically, but differs in a few structural ways.
      <br><br><br>
      <b>A E S T H E T I C</b> <br>
				I AM NOT A DESIGNER. I AM NOT A MINIMALIST. The current view of these sites plays with image & color in a way that to me indicates I am a person who is aware of ux/design concepts without employing them in ways more indicative of design principles. In general I work a lot in playing with layers, & I want this site's f i n a l f o r m to reflect that. I want to find a way to balance this general trashfire aesthetic with accessibility, though, since accessibility is critical to my work, as well. I'm going to do ux testing for different issues/versions. Part of why I <i>like</i> the layers is due to my own disabilities, and I don't want my site to exclude folks. <br>
      				My current sites also allow for expanding a specific work to show it on a blank yet still colored background, that provides more depth to the snapshot view. I'm going to find color pairs that generally have nice contrast in different types of colorblindness, since color palettes are important to my soul. <br>
      				For both of these an obvious consideration is playing with transparency/color properties of different elements.

			I really care about organization of content, & nicely designed tagging systems are some of my favorite things. I want things to link structurally at specific tagging combinations. If someone wants to find only works at the intersection of say, augmented reality & performance or motion capture & installation &<del>!NOT</del> audio, I want that to be simple. <br>
      			There will also be a menu of categories & a general feed that is sorted by ??? <br>
      			I want there to be sections pulling from different social media feeds to exist ??somewhere?? since b r a n d <br>
      			As well as a section for updates/events since a lot of what I do is performative/live (both virtually & physical--come thru for weird live a/v nonsense on ya nearest social media) <br>
      			Also I want some amount of emphasis to a section for supporting different specific projects (grants make my funding come from wealthy folx who don't fux with the vision) as well as my patreon & such, since I have to exist under capitalism, I guess

			I want to eventually have this have room for silly nested mixed media narratives in a The Ship from Beyond or Unsettling Stories type format, like the idea mentioned in the midterm assignment text about a choose your own adventure narrative. <br>
			It'd be neat if it could also use a similar format for linking similar projects into a larger narrative (BODYHOOD<---realm of many works in various mediums) <br>
			content from a code perspective: ar, video(formats?), audio, coding sketches, images (formats?), vr <br>
			content from a tag  perspective: ar, mocap, vr, code, 3D, narrative, interactive, sketches, photograaphy, illustration, comics, 2D, character design, pcomp, performance, installation, theatre, a/v, light design, spatialized audio, set design, art cars(?), construction
      <br><br><br>
      Since I intend to work on this for my Final as well, I am listing goals that are more stretch than the scope of what I can reasonably due for the midterm, so we'll see what I can & cannot do in that time, shwooooooop. I think my focuses for the midterm will be just to create a home page with a general feed/about as well as two-three content specific pages, depending on if I am going to have individual project pages link out from content pages or just expand on the same page, with a really basic tagging system, without the crossreferenced searching.
      <br><br><br>
      (tagging examples: tumblr redirects--does not have crossreferencing, newegg/amazon/zillow<del>--no !NOT---can circumvent by checking multiples in a category---doesn't apply to my model</del>)

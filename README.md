# introtoweb
Repository for intro to web

The bulk of this repo is probably going to be for my midterm/final, but I still don't super want to describe them in the main readme, so this space can include course things not related to those things. I may also decide to relocate those things to my page repo, which is located here: https://github.com/tinylionroars/tinylionroars.github.io

That's going to be gutted soon hopefully, since it is a trashfire.
Cool, great, thanks, carry on.


Stuff I typed when the class was just starting that is also a mess & just no stop immediately past me:

(My main focus rn is coding the basics design for a website i am going to eventually use to scrape from different spaces where my work is viewable online. I am currently mostly using tagging systems, so that aspect shouldn't be too bad once I get through the basic design babble
current website/portfolio goop is at tinylionroars.tumblr.com/art

Going to look back on the silly goop I did on tinylionroars.github.io (repo on here) for good css/html basix, but I'm probably not going to use jekyll this time since fuck

Need to know more about networks (servers/clients) look at mqtt code as a reference? (my coding background is less web based & more physical, so I am hoping this mqtt code Kate Sicchio provided me can help me understand networking a little better)
